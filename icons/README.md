# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often use this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Design: Simple, recognizable icon representing TTS/voice functionality
- Colors: Should work well in both light and dark themes

## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can use any placeholder PNG files with the correct dimensions, or create simple colored squares as temporary icons.

The extension will work without these files, but Chrome will show default extension icons instead.
